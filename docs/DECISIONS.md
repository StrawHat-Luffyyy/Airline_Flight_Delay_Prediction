# Setup decisions

- The web workspace uses the npm workspace package entrypoint for `@flight-delay/shared`. Its `main`, `types`, and `exports` point directly to `src/index.ts`; `web/tsconfig.json` remains unchanged. A temporary type import verified both TypeScript and Vite resolution.
- The Vite dev server uses port 5173 so the proxied health endpoint is available at the URL requested; `/api` forwards to the API on port 3001.
- The base TypeScript config maps `@flight-delay/shared` for `server/` and `shared/`; the web workspace resolves the package through npm instead.
- The health route takes a `pingMongo` function in `createApp` options so its test can simulate MongoDB without a live database. The normal route uses the Mongo client helper, which catches ping failures and reports `mongo: "down"` with HTTP 200.
- Environment values are required and validated at startup. `.env.example` and the ignored local `.env` supply the local development values; invalid or missing values produce a readable error.
- The error middleware always responds with `{ error: { code, message } }`; unmatched routes use `NOT_FOUND` and unexpected errors use HTTP 500.
- Root `typecheck` checks server, shared, and web. ESLint is configured to lint server and shared only, as requested.
- The original `bun.lock` was deleted and the npm lockfile was regenerated for the three workspaces. No dependency install used Bun or Yarn.
- MongoDB has no authentication because this compose service is for local development, and binds only to loopback on port 27017.
